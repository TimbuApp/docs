# Create API Keys

API Keys can be used to access your application features programmatically.
At Timbu we've provided organizations the ability to create and share apikeys with varying access levels.

## Create your first Api keys

To create api keys, Login to your application and find the settings menu item on the sidebar at the left side of your screen.

Follow through on the drop down and click the advanced tab.

Here's mine for reference
![create_keys_step2](/img/apis/create_keys_step2.png).

Click the `generate api key` button to reveal the pop up behind it, and then fill the form that appears.

For mine, I'd be filling my app name as `tutorial.app` and selecting public access to restrict in the permissions of the api keys, as I plan to share the keys to the public.

Conversely, you can select full access if you plan to use such keys in-house, be sure to safe gaurd your keys carefully ðŸ¤—.

Click on the `generate` button to submit the form, and then retrieve the apikeys generated for you.

**_NB: Please note Api-Keys are view once only. They can only be viewed immediately after generation. Once off your screen you would not be able to retrieve or recover them._**

On the page you should get a list of keys generated for your organization. Here's what it would look like.
