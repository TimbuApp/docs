# Create Product

Products represent each item that is sold in your organization. At Timbu, we've also provided organizations with the ability to create a product as a service.

## Create your first Product

To create a product, Login to the dashboard application, and find the products menu item on the sidebar at the left side of your screen.

Click on the `Add Product` button right above the Products table card to reveal the popup behind it.

For mine, I'd be filling my product name as `Swiss bag`, selecting `Naira` as currency, quantity of available Swiss bag products as `10`, buying price (in Naira) as `20,000` and selling price (in Naira) as `35,000`.

**_NB: Please note the selling price is the price that would be shown for each product on your organization's business platform._**

You can also check `Create Product as Service` in the additional info section if the product is a service being offered by your organization, and also enter a `Unique ID` that you may want to give the product.

Click on the `Add` button to create the product. After getting a `Product successfully created` alert, you can now click on either the `ID` or `Name` cell of the product to reveal the product detail page.

On the page you should see more details about your product. For example, you can add some additional information about your product, image(s), comment(s), and also edit the stocks using the actions drop down in the `Stocks` table card.
